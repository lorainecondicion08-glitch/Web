<p style="text-align: justify;" class="paragraph1">My solid best friends are Asiarhie and Erich, my classmates during Grade 11 and Grade 12. They were the ones who saved me from my past struggles and guided me to learn how to let go of people and move on. I have truly experienced their genuine concern for me, as they are always there to help with my needs, and whenever one of us is in need, we support each other wholeheartedly. Our friendship is built on maturity, though at times we show a little immaturity, yet we rarely have misunderstandings and always find ways to understand one another.</p>

								I consider it one of the most beautiful and memorable 
								places I’ve ever visited. I’ve been there three times, 
								and each visit holds a special memory. The first time, 
								I went with my older sister; the second, we were joined 
								by our sibling; and the last time, it was just me, my 
								sister, and our mom. It was during Christmas—we watched 
								a movie and had dinner at a restaurant there. That day 
								became our final bonding moment with our mom before 
she passed away due to cancer. Although it’s painful, 
I find comfort in knowing that she is now healed and at 
peace in the presence of the Lord. This place will always 
hold a special place in my heart, not just for its beauty, 
but for the precious memories it gave me.

and this photo was taken during our school's prom—the 
Tuy Senior High School Masquerade Prom. It was such 
an enjoyable and unforgettable event, as it marked 
the last time we celebrated together with our classmates,
 schoolmates, friends, and teachers. The night was 
filled with laughter, dancing, and heartfelt memories 
that I will cherish forever. Looking back, it was a 
beautiful ending to an incredible chapter of our lives.
